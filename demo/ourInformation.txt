Event loop:

Timers: This phase deals with timer callbacks that have reached their scheduled time. Timers in Node.js can be used to schedule code execution after a specified delay or at specific intervals. When a timer’s time comes, its callback function is added to the event queue to be executed.
Timers are not guaranteed to execute exactly at their scheduled time, as they are subject to the availability of the system and the event loop. For example, if the event loop is busy processing other events, the timer callback may be delayed until the next iteration of the event loop. Therefore, timers should not be used for precise timing, but rather for approximate timing.
Timers are also subject to the system clock’s drift, which means that the actual time may differ from the expected time by a small margin. This can happen due to various factors, such as changes in the system time, daylight saving time, leap seconds, etc. Therefore, timers should not be used for critical operations that depend on the exact time, but rather for general operations that can tolerate some variance.
I/O Callbacks: During this phase, the event loop processes I/O callbacks that are ready to run. These callbacks are triggered by completed I/O operations, such as data being received over the network or a file read operation completing. By processing these callbacks, Node.js can continue executing code without waiting for I/O to finish.
I/O callbacks are usually generated by the system kernel or the thread pool, which notify Node.js when an I/O operation is done. Node.js then adds the corresponding callback to the event queue, where it will be executed by the event loop. However, some types of I/O callbacks are deferred to the next loop iteration, such as TCP or UDP errors, or some file operations. These callbacks are handled in the pending callbacks phase, which will be discussed later.
Idle, Prepare: These two phases are less commonly discussed but are still part of the event loop. The “idle” phase is where idle callbacks are executed, which are typically used for internal purposes like garbage collection. The “prepare” phase is used to prepare for the next cycle of the event loop, resetting certain variables and flags.
Idle callbacks are registered by calling process.nextTick(), which is a Node.js-specific API that allows you to schedule a callback to be executed at the end of the current operation, before the event loop moves to the next phase. This can be useful for performing some quick or urgent tasks that need to be done before the next event loop cycle.
Prepare callbacks are registered by calling process.setImmediate(), which is another Node.js-specific API that allows you to schedule a callback to be executed at the beginning of the next event loop cycle, after the poll phase. This can be useful for performing some tasks that need to be done as soon as possible, but not before the current operation finishes.
Poll: This phase is the main phase of the event loop, where most of the I/O events are handled. The poll phase retrieves new I/O events from the system kernel or the thread pool, and executes their callbacks. This includes events from network connections, file operations, and other sources. The event loop will block here when there are no other events to process, waiting for new events to arrive.
The poll phase also checks if there are any timers that have expired, and executes their callbacks if there are. This means that timers can influence the duration of the poll phase, depending on how many timers are scheduled and how long they take to execute. If there are no timers or I/O events, the event loop will move to the next phase.
Check: This phase executes callbacks registered by process.setImmediate(). These callbacks are executed after the poll phase and before the close callbacks phase. This phase allows Node.js to handle some tasks that need to be done as soon as possible, but not before the current operation finishes.
Close Callbacks: This phase executes callbacks related to closing events, such as socket or stream closures. These callbacks are usually registered by calling socket.on('close', callback) or stream.on('end', callback). This phase allows Node.js to perform some cleanup operations and release some resources when a connection or a stream is closed.
